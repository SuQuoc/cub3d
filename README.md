Standard cmds like add, commit pull will only affect the bracnh u are in!

git checkout "branchname"     = switches branch to "branchname"
git checkout -b "branchname"  = creates a branch and checksout (switches) into it
git branch -d "branchname"    = deletes a branch if it was merged to main, you must be in main branch for the cmd
git branch -D "branchname"    = deletes a branch even if not merged to main
git branch -a                 = shows all branches and in which u are currently in
